[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/friendlycode.png?branch=gh-pages)](http://travis-ci.org/mozilla/friendlycode)

This is a friendly HTML editor that uses [slowparse][] and [hacktionary][]
to provide ultra-friendly real-time help to novice webmakers.

## Prerequisites

Using Friendlycode doesn't actually require anything other than a
static file server like Apache. However, if you want to generate optimized
builds and run the test suites, you'll need node 0.8+, npm 1.1+, and
phantomjs 1.7+.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/mozilla/friendlycode.git
cd friendlycode
npm install
npm test
```

To run a simple built-in static file server from the repository's
root directory, run:

```bash
node bin/server.js
```

## Examples

You can see a trivial embedding at:

    http://localhost:8005/examples/bare.html

By default, friendlycode doesn't allow JS. An example of an
embedding that allows JS and publishes using an alternate API is
here:

    http://localhost:8005/examples/alternate-publisher.html

## Localization

Before localizing, please read the [requirejs i18n bundle][i18n] 
documentation.

To create a localization, first run `node bin/build-i18n.js list`
to display a list of i18n bundle modules that can be localized. You'll
need to localize all of these to create a complete localization, but
anything you don't localize will just fall-back to English.

Suppose you decide you want to localize the `fc/nls/ui` module to `fr-fr`.
Just do the following:

1. Create the `js/fc/nls/fr-fr` directory if it doesn't already exist.
2. Run `node bin/build-i18n.js template fc/nls/ui > js/fc/nls/fr-fr/ui.js`.
3. Localize the strings in `js/fc/nls/fr-fr/ui.js`.
4. Edit `js/fc/nls/ui.js` and add `"fr-fr": true` to the object being returned
   by the module.

You can test out your localization by setting your browser's language
preference to `fr-fr` and then loading any embedding of your repository's
friendlycode widget in your browser.

## Updating CodeMirror

In the `vendor/codemirror2` directory is a mini-distribution of
[CodeMirror][] which contains only the files necessary for HTML editing. It 
can be updated with the `bin/update-codemirror.py` script.
